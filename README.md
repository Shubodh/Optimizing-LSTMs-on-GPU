# Optimizing-LSTMs-on-GPU
Implementation of the paper "Optimizing Performance of Recurrent Neural Networks on GPUs" in CUDA and OpenMP.

For now, it has the most naive implementation of LSTM. Will be adding more efficient version of the naive implementation soon.

With default parameters, the naive will take a long time to run. Use lower dimensions first to run it faster and then the default ones could be tried.
